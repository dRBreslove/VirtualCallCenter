## Overview

Virtual Call Center is a simulation tool that models the behaviors of a real-world call center. It can be used to test call routing, manage simulated call flows, and serve as a backend for developing interactive call center UIs. This repository is designed with both local development and cloud deployment in mind.

## Features

- **Call Simulation:** Emulate incoming and outgoing calls with adjustable parameters.
- **Routing Logic:** Customize call routing based on dynamic rules and conditions.
- **Web Dashboard:** Monitor simulations and view logs or statistics in real time.
- **Integrations:** Easy connectivity for third-party APIs and extended functionalities.
- **Cloud Integration:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with modern cloud services like Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
